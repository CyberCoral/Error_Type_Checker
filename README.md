# Error_Type_Checker

It's an automatic checker for the most common variable types and any kind of conditions you will use, making checks for any variable you want automatically without wasting code on error handling. 

It also makes truth lists out of binary numbers, which can be used in ErrorTypeFinder() and it's implemented in AutomatedErrorTypeFinder() natively.
